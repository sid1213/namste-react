**What is CDN and how it Works?**

*CDN (Content delivery Networks):-  CDN’s are using to make our loads faster. basically we can place our some part of assets on distributed network to reduce the load-time that’s the main reason we use CDN.* 

*How it works-* 
*Basically we can deploy assets from multiple pops(nodes) for each assets around the world. so when a user sends a request the response will be sent to him from the nearest pop-center(data-center) from the user. this also cache the assets and send it to it’s co-related pos so data is always shared and updated.*

*ReactDOM- ReactDOM handles the task of rendering those interfaces in a web environment.*

**What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?**

*The react.development.js is for development the react app so any developer can read the codes of development.js file. where as the Production..js is a minified code which is not human readable at all. but it's a consised code which we should use on production so the code will get executed faster.*

**What is async and defer?**

*async:- 'async' is a attribute which we use in script tag. it basically parallel load the javascript from server without blocking html/Document Parsing. and once the the script loads from the server the js code will run and stop paring the html. and the parsing will resume once the script code will executed*

#JSX------>react.createElement()------>React object-------> html/js---->loads to browser.

**Babel is a powerful and widely-used JavaScript compiler that has become an essential tool for developers. It allows developers to write modern JavaScript code and transpile it into a version that can run in all environments, including modern browsers and older ones. In this article, we will take a deep dive into the scope and purpose of Babel in react, its introduction as a transpiler, its use in React, the need for Babel in react, its key characteristics, and its role in converting JSX syntax.**
